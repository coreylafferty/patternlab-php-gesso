&lt;p&gt;There was an &lt;em&gt;Englishman&lt;/em&gt; in our compartment, and he complimented me on&amp;mdash;on what? But you would never guess. He complimented me on my English. He said Americans in general did not speak the English language as correctly as I did. I said I was obliged to him for his compliment, since I knew he meant it for one, but that I was not fairly entitled to it, for I did not speak English at all&amp;mdash;I only spoke American.&lt;/p&gt;
